This is a collection of shell scripts to help do a few aws ec2 commands programmatically.
Need to install awscli package in your environment and then can use the scripts to start up instances, create volumes, mount volumes, save snapshots and then terminate.

Mainly used to save costs by running GPU instances only for the time you need for large computational projects and then saving volumes and snapshots and then for other data processing etc to be able to use cheaper machines on aws.
